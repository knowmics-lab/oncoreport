**OncoReport** is a user-friendly software system for the analysis of DNA-seq data coming either from solid or liquid biopsy samples. The aim of **OncoReport** to identify the patients' tumor mutations allowing the help in the definition of the most suitable therapy.

## Usage 
### Inputs
The pipeline takes several inputs:
-	fastq  
-	bam
-	ubam
-	vcf (it also possible to upload a varianttable sample in this section)
**OncoReport** allows users to easily generate rich reports to support clinical interpretation of variants and their association to prognosis and therapy. 

### Patients creation

After installing the app, it is possible to start immediately the analysis.
First of all, the user has to create a new patient using the "+" in the patients screen.
You can see from the image the specific of the patients page.


![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f439b440-c3c2-433f-b37a-e393a8ea7955)


The information needed to add a new patient are:
- The Patient's Code*
- Patient's First and Last Name*
- Patient's Age*
- Patient's Gender*
- Fiscal Number
- Email*
- Telephone
- City
- Primary Disease* The disease that the user wants to analyze
- Disease type
- Diagnosis Date
- T, the stage of the patient's tumor
- N, the lymph node number
- M, the presence or absence of metastasis


The information indicated with the asterisk are mandatory.

After the patient creation, it is also possible to add information about other diseases of the patient and about the drugs already taken. 
In this way OncoReport is able to discover possible drug-drug interactions.

### Analysis creation

For each patient it is possible to add more than one analysis. 
At the end of each analysis we will have as output the logs, the report and an archive of the raw annotated output.

![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3695861b-5957-4190-84a0-6e6115de2b0f)


The user needs to provide analysis sample code, analysis name, the type of analysis, the input type and the number of threads that are gonna be used by the machine. It is possible to upload fastq, bam, ubam or vcf files. The user has also the chance to choose between two human reference genomes: GRCh37 (hg19) and GRCh38 (hg38). The user has also to specify if the samples are paired end. 

It is possible to make two types of analysis:

1. **The Tumor vs Normal analysis**
It takes two inputs, a tumor sample and a normal sample. This analysis compare the two samples to remove all the germline mutation of the tumor sample. In this way the report will annotate only the somatic mutations. It is necessary to specify the "Depth filter" of the analysis.

![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/351961d9-548f-4405-adf2-fe44d3995573)

2. **The Tumor only analysis** 
It takes only the tumor sample. This tumor sample can originate both from a solid biopsy or a liquid biopsy. Here is necessary to specify both the "Depth filter" for variant calling and the "Allele Fraction Filter". The latter it is needed to split the somatic mutations from the germline ones since we do not have the normal samples. We suggest to use Less and equal to 0.3 for liquid biopsy and Less and equal to 0.4 for solid biopsy.

# The Report
OncoReport' goal is the automatic generation of a report describing all the possible annotations (both prognostic and therapeutic) associated to the patients' mutations.
To reach this purpose, it employees several databases which will allow to synthetize a **precision medicine therapy report** for the patient.

![immagine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57007795/163543139-4829d077-320b-46d7-b2ed-eaa0ceaf1bfd.png)

When the analysis finish the user can both interactively consult the report from the app or download locally a compressed version of it. 
Once decompressed the report will be available within a folder and the user will be able to consult it by clicking on the "index" file.

The report is composed by four main sections. An additional section named "other details" provides further information on the mutation annotations.

## Therapeutic indications

![immagine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57007795/163544477-8e6b3d1c-d7b1-4ff2-a0a6-ffb777da80b2.png)


This section contains two tables providing information on the mutations' clinical impact. The first table reports mutations yielding therapeutic evidence going from Validated association, to clinical evidence and FDA approved drugs. The second table is called ***other evidences*** which are not already used in the clinical context. It includes all the mutations that have been marked as "Case study" evidence level, "Preclinical evidence" and so on. 

In both tables the user will find the **name of the gene and the variants** which have been found mutated in the patient and the **drugs** associated with these specific mutations. The presence of more than one drug per row indicates the usage of such drugs in combination. 
The **evidence type**, can be:
* predictive and therefore associated with a drug that can bring a response;
* Diagnostic, this underlines the impact, positive (e.g. higer incidence of the disease) or negative (e.g. lower incidence of the disease), of the mutation on the patient;
* Prognostic, the impact of a variant on the patient's disease;
* Predisposing, the possibility that the variant predisposes the patient to the illness;
* Oncogenic, a somatic variant that it is involved in tumor pathogenesis;
* Functional, if the variant causes or not alteration of the function of the protein produced by the gene.
This information is taken from the two databases: CIViC and Cancer Genome Interpreter (CGI).
The **Clinical Significance** changes when the evidence type changes. For our purpose the most interesting are:
* Sensitivity/Response which is associated with the possible response of the patient, having that specific mutation, to the treatment with that drug;
* Resistance, which is associated with the possible resistance of the patient, having that specific mutation, to the treatment with that drug;
* Adverse Response to the drug treatment;
* Reduced Sensitivity when the patients respond to the treatment, but not in the best way possible.
**Type** of mutation which can be somatic or germline.
**Details**, when details about that evidence exists the user can click on the plus and reach to the subsection ***Clinical Evidence Details*** where it is possible to find information about the evidence and the study of that evidence.

**Trials** Clicking on trials the users can reach the "ClinicalTrials.gov" page where they will find all the existing trials for the drug-variant combination.
**References** Clicking on reference the users reach the Reference Section. Here, they will be able to consult the pubmed paper from which the evidence was taken clicking on the PMID.

**Score**
The evidence score is calculated using variant's pathogenic information, the repetition of the drug for the same mutation and the evidence publication year.

**AIFA**, **EMA**, **FDA**
Information about the approval of drugs by the AIFA, EMA and FDA agencies. When there are three ticks it means that the drug or the combination of drugs has been approved by all the agency. 

![immagine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57007795/167890613-14092357-2601-4faa-a535-c993d5c78511.png)

When the "x" is found, it means that at least one of the drug has not been approved by that specific agency.

**Publication year**
The year of the evidence publication.
